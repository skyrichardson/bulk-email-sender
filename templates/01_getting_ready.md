How to get ready for bootcamp

The bootcamp is designed for individual-level setup mastery. 

During the bootcamp, you will individually present your setup selection from bullish and bearish setups. Based on the last few bootcamps, when first-time participants select a setup; on average 90% get it wrong. However,everyone gets it right by the 3rd attempt.

So how can you speed up your understanding of the setup?  

By going through the guide section before arriving at bootcamp, you will be in a much better position to benefit from the bootcamp.

Here are some more suggestions:  
 - Ensure you have scans and charts in place before arriving  
 - Do not plan anything for evening and night as every evening you will have substantial homework to do  

Your objective for bootcamp should be to have 100% mind clarity for these setups and the ability to trade them profitably.

The next time I contact you will be with resources to ensure you have TC2000 set up correctly.

If you have any questions, please free to ask in the Group chat or contact me by email (and not EG).
