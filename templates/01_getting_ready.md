How to get ready for bootcamp

The bootcamp is designed for individual-level setup mastery. 

During the bootcamp, you will individually present your setup selection from bullish and bearish setups. Based on the last few bootcamps, when first-time participants select a setup; on average 90% get it wrong. However,everyone gets it right by the 3rd attempt.

So how can you speed up your understanding of the setup? Here is how fellow bootcamper [Steertire](https://stockbee.biz/aggregator/tweets/archive/Steertire/) approached attending bootcamp:  
> I have all the scans and have watched all the guides several times as well as having bought and practiced the online bootcamp from January 2024.

Here are some more suggestions:
 - View the videos in the [guide](https://stockbee.biz/learning-area/) section
 - Ensure you have [scans and charts](https://stockbee.biz/video/2025-03-09-how-to-setup-tc2000-scans-for-beginners/) in place before arriving  
 - Do not plan anything for evening and night as every evening you will have substantial homework to do  

Your objective for bootcamp should be to have 100% mind clarity for these setups and the ability to trade them profitably.
