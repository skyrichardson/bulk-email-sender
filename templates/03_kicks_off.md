Reminder: Bootcamp kicks off this Friday

The bootcamp kicks off this Friday at 9:00 AM and we could not be more excited.

Here are a few reminders to help you get the most out of this event:

- Ensure you have scans and charts in place before arriving.
- Do not plan anything for evening and night as every evening you will have substantial homework to do
- Ensure you have 100% mind clarity for what you are about to learn
