How to get ready for bootcamp

The bootcamp is designed for individual-level setup mastery. 

Between now and bootcamp kick-off, please review the guide section.

Here are some more suggestions:  
 - Ensure you have scans and charts in place before arriving.  
 - Do not plan anything for evening and night as every evening you will have substantial homework to do.  

Your objective for bootcamp should be to have 100% mind clarity for these setups and the ability to trade them profitably.

_So what will the bootcamp be like?_

The online bootcamp will be similar to the daily Zoom meetings format. You do not need to have a webcam or microphone. You can use Zoom chat to ask questions.
Any assignments or homework will need to presented as a Google doc or slide.

The next time I contact you will be with resources to ensure you have TC2000 set up correctly.
